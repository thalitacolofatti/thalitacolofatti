### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Django, Javascript, GraphQL, ReactJS, NodeJS, Typescript, Azure and so on...</br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that use ReactJs or Python, so I can practice what I am learning.</br>
ðŸ“« How to reach me: thalitacolofatti@gmail.com</br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about illustrations or art. ðŸ¥°</br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I am a architect and I have designed houses and landscape for 10 years. I also have designed a simple game a year ago using Adobe Animate and I would love to study animations again.
