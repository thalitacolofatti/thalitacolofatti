### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity VR (C#), Python, Java </br>
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that use Unity, Python and Java, so I can practice what I am learning.</br>
ğŸ“« How to reach me: thalitacolofatti@gmail.com or @filoactto on Instagram</br>
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about illustrations or art. ğŸ¥°</br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I am an architect and I have designed houses and landscape for 10 years. I also have designed games and I would love to study animations again.
